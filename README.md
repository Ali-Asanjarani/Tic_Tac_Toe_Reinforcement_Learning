# Tic-Tac-Toe with Reinforcement Learning 🎮🤖

### **🔍 About the Project**
This is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game enhanced with **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**! 🤓 The AI learns from its experience to improve its gameplay using a Firebase database to store and update its states.

**Features:**
- 🎯 A smart AI that evolves over time.
- 🗃️ Game data storage in **Firebase** for continuous learning.
- 🖥️ Simple text-based output for cross-platform compatibility.

### **🚀 How to Run**

#### **1. Prerequisites**
Ensure the following are installed:
- **Python 3.8 or higher**
- Required libraries:
  random
  os
  requests
  firebase-admin
  json

#### **2. Running the Game**
-  Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ali-asanjarany/Tic_Tac_Toe_Reinforcement_Learning.git
```

-  Execute the main file:

```bash
python tic_tac_toe.py
```
-  Follow the on-screen instructions to play! 🚀

### **💡 How It Works** 
* The **Agent (AI)** uses **TD Learning (Temporal Difference)** to determine the best moves.
* Game states and their corresponding values are stored in Firebase.
* Over time, the AI becomes smarter and more challenging to beat! 🤯”

### **📋 Rules and Instructions**


* **How to Play?**

  *  **The human player (O) selects positions by entering numbers.**
  *  **The Agent (X) automatically selects its moves based on learned strategies.**
* **Position mapping on the board:**
```bash
 7 | 8 | 9
-----------
 4 | 5 | 6
-----------
 1 | 2 | 3
```
### **📸 Sample Output**
```bash
 O | - | X 
-----------
 - | O | - 
-----------
 X | X | O 
Congratulations! You won! 🎉 Ready for the next round?
